# What are options?
## Greeks
### Delta
- ATM call has delta 0.5
- OTM call has delta 0
- ITM call has delta 1

Buy Call-Put Parity: $ C - P = S - K e^{-rT} $, buying a call and a shorting a put is 
equivalent to buying the stock with borrowed money of $K e^{-rT} $

Obviously
$$
- C  + (P + S - K e^{-rT})= 0
$$
So to hedge a short position in call, one would need to long the stock, buy a put, and borrow $K e^{-rT} $ of cash


### Gamma
High means convex trade (delta moves faster than underlying)

Highest for ATM

Close to 0 for OTM and ITM

### Vega
WRT Change in implied vol

Gamma and vega usually always positive

IV is usually higher for ITM and OTM options than ATM

Shorting Vega means selling options and profiting from the risk premium
(but faces an unlimited risk)


### Volatility
Standard deviation of log return of some risky assets

Stocks usually exhibit volatility clustering (volatile days follow volatile days)


### Brownian motion

1.B_0 = 0, for any  0,t1...,tn, increment Bt2 - Bt1, are independent  
2.stationary & normal: Bt+h - Bt depend on h only, Bt+h - Bt ~ N(0, h)  
3.Continuous path, B(t) cont over t

### filtration/sigma algebera Ft:

set of all events up to time t

### Martingale
1.Xt is Ft measurable  
2.E[Xt] is finite for all t  
3.E[Xt|Fs] = Xs (expecation of future given past information is current value)  

This suggests there is no systematic way to predict future changes and make a guaranteed profit.

### Black-Scholes

Assumptions  
1. Efficient market (all past information already reflected in current stock price)  
2. Stock price follows geometric brownian motion, or Log(St) is normal 
(i.e. St = S0 exp( (mu - sig^2/2)t + sig Wt) )   
3. Volatility is assumed to be constant  
4. Risk free rate constant and known
5. Arbitrage free

### call-put parity
C - P = S - Ke^-rT  

If C is cheaper, can buy C sell P and also short the stock  
hedged against price and profit from selling P  

Can also construct butterfly with the cheap C: Buy call at K1 and K3, short C at K2

### Volatility smile

implied volatility (IV) is higher for options that are deep in-the-money or out-of-the-money compared to at-the-money options. 

Cannot compute IV analytically, have to numerical (bisection or newton)

- Input requirement: max(S0 - Ke^-rT, 0) < call price < stock price

- Why does it exist?
ITM and OTM options are more in demand than ATM options
Consumers buy in-the-money (K > S0e^rT) put as insurance for stock crash (payoff = K - ST)  
ITM put and OTM call has intrinsic value

Fixed income products, how to price how to hedge

What are swaps

### volatility trading
During periods of high volatility, price fluctuations are more frequent, creating more opportunities for market makers to capture the bid-ask spread.  
At same time, higher risk too. To hedge, may need wider spread.  
Less volatile times (more liquidity), can have tight spread, less risk of unfavorable move

Trading gamma:  
Positive gamma, or convex option: 
Stock up -> delta up -> option up even faster  
During volatile times, option would be even more volatile, need to hedge more frequently  
more opportunies for bid-ask spread, also can keep buying low and selling high

### options, futures, swaps
forward-similar to future, but OTC, cannot be priced
swaps - agreement to exchange cash flow, priced on net present value
futures - S0 * e^rT (no up-front payment)


### GARCH for volatility forecast
sig_t^2 = long_term_vol + a * eps_t-1^2 + b * sig_t-1^2

long_term_vol: fixed constant  
eps_t-1: residual derived from log return log(Rt/Rt-1) with mean removed  
sig_t-1: previous volatility (can be implied volatility from Black-Scholes)





## Fixed Income 
interest rates often follow stochastic processes (e.g., Vasicek, CIR).
1. Explain monte carlo
run large number of senarios to aggregate, useful when analytical solutions are difficult

2. Explain VaR for a portfolio  
VaR = Upper bound of Confidence interval for the loss  
ES = E[ loss | loss > VaR]  

VaR ignores tail risk. One can say 99% confident Loss won't exceed 1M, but within the 1% chance, don't know if it's 1M or 1B. ES addresses this

Also VAR is not subadditive: risk(A+B) < risk(A) + risk(B), which encourage diversification

3. Pricing interest rate swaps. 

forward-similar to future, but OTC, cannot be priced
swaps - agreement to exchange cash flow, priced on net present value
futures - S0 * e^rT (no up-front payment)

4. How to hedge bond portfolio against interest rate risk using swaps

5. What are the key risk factors in a fixed income portfolio?

6. If 10-year Treasury yields rise by 20 bps, how would you expect corporate bond spreads to behave and why?
7. A zero-coupon bond matures in 5 years. How does its price sensitivity to interest rates compare to a 5-year coupon bond?  
8. Bond portfolio sharpe ratio

## Fx




## Pricing options with Monte Carlo
Simulate payoff with Geometric brownian motion
Then option price = e^-rT * (average payoff)

Used when Closed-form solutions are unavailable (e.g. multi-asset options)

Converges at O(1/sqrt(N)), very slow and expensive

## Risk management
Can use PCA to find which risks contribute to portfolio's risk

Look for dimension of max variance, opposed to ICA which look for least entropy (least normal)

Also find which factors drive asset returns (macro factors)


### Inefficiency vs Arbitrage-free

A market can be inefficient but not arbitrage-free.  

A stock may exhibit price momentum because markets fail to quickly incorporate information.

Traders could exploit this pattern (inefficiency) by predicting future price movements, but this involves risk.

At the same time, the market could be arbitrage-free because there are no riskless opportunities to exploit inconsistencies in pricing.

### Ito's formula
Given dX = mu dt + sig dW

for some f(X):  
df = (dfdt + mu * dfdx + 1/2 sig^2 * d^fdx^2)dt + sig * dfdx dW
