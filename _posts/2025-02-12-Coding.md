# General Computer Science questions

## **Hash Tables**
### What is a hash table, and how does it work?
- A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.
- It allows for fast lookups, inserts, and deletions.

**Time Complexity**:
- **Average Case**: \( O(1) \) for insertion, search, and delete.
- **Worst Case**: \( O(n) \) for all three operations when all keys map to the same bucket due to collisions.

### What is a hash collision, and how can it be handled?
- A hash collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same index.
- **Collision Handling Techniques**:
  - **Chaining**: Use linked lists to store multiple keys in the same bucket.
  - **Open Addressing**: Probes the next available slot in the array.

### What is a good hash function?
- Uniformly distributes keys across the hash table.
- Minimizes collisions.
- Efficient to compute.

## **Heap**
### What is a heap, and how is it used?
- A heap is a specialized binary tree used to maintain a priority queue.
- **Min-Heap**: The smallest element is at the root.
- **Max-Heap**: The largest element is at the root.

**Time Complexity**:
- **Find Min/Max**: \( O(1) \)
- **Insert/Delete**: \( O(\log n) \)
- **Building a Heap**: \( O(n) \)
- **Heap Sort**: \( O(n \log n) \)

### **BST vs. Heap**
- **Heap**: Ensures the highest/lowest priority element is always at the root.
- **BST**: Maintains an ordered structure where the left child is smaller and the right child is larger than the parent.

**Time Complexity**:
- **Search in BST**:
  - **Average**: \( O(\log n) \)
  - **Worst Case (Unbalanced)**: \( O(n) \)

## **SQL Concepts**
### What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a row and cannot have `NULL` values.
- **Unique Key**: Ensures uniqueness but allows one `NULL` value.

### What is the purpose of indexing in a database?
- Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval by allowing faster row lookups compared to scanning the entire table.
- Especially useful for large datasets.

### What is normalization in SQL?
- The process of organizing a database to:
  - Reduce redundancy.
  - Improve data integrity.
  - Achieved by dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

### What is a foreign key in SQL?
- A column (or group of columns) that establishes a link between data in two tables.
- Enforces **referential integrity** by ensuring a value in one table matches a value in another.

### What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
- **OUTER JOIN**:
  - **LEFT OUTER JOIN**: Includes all rows from the left table, with `NULL` for unmatched rows in the right table.
  - **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**: Includes all rows from the right table, with `NULL` for unmatched rows in the left table.
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Includes all rows from both tables, with `NULL` for unmatched rows.

## **Big O Notation**
- \( f(x) = O(g(x)) \) if there exist constants \( M > 0 \) and \( n > 0 \) such that:
  \[
  |f(x)| \leq M \cdot |g(x)| \text{ for all } x > n.
  \]

## **Linked List vs. Array**
| **Operation**               | **Linked List** | **Array**          |
|------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Access by Index**          | \( O(n) \)      | \( O(1) \)         |
| **Search (Sorted)**          | \( O(n) \)      | \( O(\log n) \)    |
| **Insertion/Deletion at Head** | \( O(1) \)      | \( O(n) \) (may require resizing) |
| **Insertion/Deletion at Index** | \( O(n) \)      | \( O(n) \)         |

## **C++ Concepts**
### **Key Features**
1. **Speed and Low Latency**: Ideal for real-time risk analysis and pricing.
2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - `malloc()` and `free()` for heap memory (manual management).
   - Classes typically use static memory (automatically managed).

### **Multithreading**:
- Unlike Python, C++ does not have a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), enabling true multithreading.

### **Namespaces**:
- Avoid name collisions by organizing code logically.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
- **Inheritance**: Base and derived classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Runtime behavior via `virtual` functions.
- **Encapsulation**: Hiding data within classes.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems.

### **Structs**:
- Groups different data types into a single entity.

### **Floating-Point Types**:
- `float`: 32-bit precision.
- `double`: 64-bit precision.

### **Virtual Functions**:
- Enable runtime polymorphism and allow overriding parent methods.

### **Pure virtual function**
- a virtual function that is declared within a base class but has no implementation in that class

pure virtual vs virtual:

| Aspect                | Pure Virtual                                      | Virtual                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Declared with `= 0`, no implementation in the base class. | Can have an implementation in the base class. |
| **Syntax**            | `virtual void func() = 0;`                        | `virtual void func() { ... };`             |

---

| Aspect                | Pure Virtual                                      | Virtual                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Purpose**   | Defines an **interface** in the base class.       | Provides a **default behavior** in the base class. |
| **Requirement**       | Derived classes **must** override the function unless the derived class is also abstract. | Derived classes **may** override the function, but it is not required. |
| **Base Class Usage**  | Makes the base class **abstract** (non-instantiable). | The base class can still be instantiated.  |
| **Polymorphism**      | Ensures all derived classes implement the same interface. | Allows derived classes to optionally customize behavior. |

### **hiding in C++**
Derived class also define function in same name as base class (just like polymorphism with virtual). 

but provide a new definition in the derived class that is unrelated to the base class member.

The function in base class is just void, not virtual.

Hiding uses compile-time binding, virtual functions uses runtime binding.

### memory leak, memory overhead, memory overflow, memory corruption  
- Memory leak: Program fails to release memory, should free memory after use  
- Memory overhead: Program requiring extra memory (e.g. dynamic memory allocation)  
- Memory overflow: Program uses more memory than available  
(e.g. stack overflow, call stack reaches max recursion depth)  
- Memory corruption: Program modifies memory it does not own  
Can lead to crashes and data loss

## **Python**
1. **How to handle exceptions?**  
   Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.

2. **Difference between `deepcopy` and `shallowcopy`?**  
   - **Deepcopy**: Copies all objects recursively.  
   - **Shallowcopy**: Only copies the reference for nested objects.

3. **Pandas**
- How is a Pandas DataFrame different from an SQL table?  

Both represent tabular data, but a Pandas DataFrame is an in-memory object for data manipulation in Python, while an SQL table is part of a relational database.

- How to detect missing data  

isnull()

- Difference between loc and iloc?

loc uses column/row labels  
iloc uses integet indices

- concat vs merge vs join

concat(): Stacks DataFrames along rows or columns.  
merge(): Combines DataFrames based on common columns or indices, similar to SQL joins.  
join(): Combines DataFrames based on their indices.

## **SQL**
1. **Primary key vs unique key?**  
   - **Primary Key**: Ensures uniqueness and no `NULL` values.  
   - **Unique Key**: Ensures uniqueness but allows one `NULL` value.

e.g. For a table of students, StudentID can be `primary key` (must-have, unique, cannot be null)  
Student_name can be `unique key` also unique but can be null

2. **What is indexing?**  
   Improves query speed by creating a data structure for fast lookups on columns.

3. **What is normalization?**  
   Organizing data to reduce redundancy and ensure integrity by dividing tables logically.

   Links data between tables, enforcing that values in one table exist in another.  
   e.g. In another table called Course_Enrolment, can have `StudentID` columns referencing students taking this course

5. **INNER JOIN vs OUTER JOIN?**  
   - **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows.  
   - **OUTER JOIN**: Includes unmatched rows with `NULLs`.
