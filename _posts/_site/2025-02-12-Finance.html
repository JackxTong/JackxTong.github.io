<h3 id="delta">Delta</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ATM call has delta 0.5</li>
  <li>OTM call has delta 0</li>
  <li>ITM call has delta 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Buy Call-Put Parity: $ C - P = S - K e^{-rT} $, buying a call and a shorting a put is 
equivalent to buying the stock with borrowed money of $K e^{-rT} $</p>

<p>Obviously</p>

\[- C  + (P + S - K e^{-rT})= 0\]

<p>So to hedge a short position in call, one would need to long the stock, buy a put, and borrow $K e^{-rT} $ of cash</p>

<h3 id="gamma">Gamma</h3>
<p>High means convex trade (delta moves faster than underlying)</p>

<p>Highest for ATM</p>

<p>Close to 0 for OTM and ITM</p>

<h3 id="vega">Vega</h3>
<p>WRT Change in implied vol</p>

<p>Gamma and vega usually always positive</p>

<p>IV is usually higher for ITM and OTM options than ATM</p>

<p>Shorting Vega means selling options and profiting from the risk premium
(but faces an unlimited risk)</p>

<h3 id="volatility">Volatility</h3>
<p>Standard deviation of log return of some risky assets</p>

<p>Stocks usually exhibit volatility clustering (volatile days follow volatile days)</p>

<h3 id="brownian-motion">Brownian motion</h3>

<p>1.B_0 = 0, for any  0,t1…,tn, increment Bt2 - Bt1, are independent<br />
2.stationary &amp; normal: Bt+h - Bt depend on h only, Bt+h - Bt ~ N(0, h)<br />
3.Continuous path, B(t) cont over t</p>

<h3 id="filtrationsigma-algebera-ft">filtration/sigma algebera Ft:</h3>

<h3 id="martingale">Martingale</h3>
<p>1.Xt is Ft measurable<br />
2.E[Xt] is finite for all t<br />
3.E[Xt|Fs] = Xs (expecation of future given past information is current value)</p>

<p>This suggests there is no systematic way to predict future changes and make a guaranteed profit.</p>

<h3 id="black-scholes">Black-Scholes</h3>

<p>Assumptions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Efficient market (all past information already reflected in current stock price)</li>
  <li>Stock price follows geometric brownian motion, or Log(St) is normal 
(i.e. St = S0 exp( (mu - sig^2/2)t + sig Wt) )</li>
  <li>Volatility is assumed to be constant</li>
  <li>Risk free rate constant and known</li>
  <li>Arbitrage free</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="call-put-parity">call-put parity</h3>
<p>C - P = S - Ke^-rT</p>

<p>If C is cheaper, can buy C sell P and also short the stock<br />
hedged against price and profit from selling P</p>

<p>Can also construct butterfly with the cheap C: Buy call at K1 and K3, short C at K2</p>

<h3 id="volatility-smile">Volatility smile</h3>

<p>implied volatility (IV) is higher for options that are deep in-the-money or out-of-the-money compared to at-the-money options.</p>

<p>Cannot compute IV analytically, have to numerical (bisection or newton)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Input requirement: max(S0 - Ke^-rT, 0) &lt; call price &lt; stock price</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why does it exist?
ITM and OTM options are more in demand than ATM options
Consumers buy in-the-money (K &gt; S0e^rT) put as insurance for stock crash (payoff = K - ST)<br />
ITM put and OTM call has intrinsic value</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed income products, how to price how to hedge</p>

<p>What are swaps</p>

<h3 id="volatility-trading">volatility trading</h3>
<p>During periods of high volatility, price fluctuations are more frequent, creating more opportunities for market makers to capture the bid-ask spread.<br />
At same time, higher risk too. To hedge, may need wider spread.<br />
Less volatile times (more liquidity), can have tight spread, less risk of unfavorable move</p>

<p>Trading gamma:<br />
Positive gamma, or convex option: 
Stock up -&gt; delta up -&gt; option up even faster<br />
During volatile times, option would be even more volatile, need to hedge more frequently<br />
more opportunies for bid-ask spread, also can keep buying low and selling high</p>

<h3 id="options-futures-swaps">options, futures, swaps</h3>
<p>forward-similar to future, but OTC, cannot be priced
swaps - agreement to exchange cash flow, priced on net present value
futures - S0 * e^rT (no up-front payment)</p>

<h3 id="garch-for-volatility-forecast">GARCH for volatility forecast</h3>

\[\sigma_t^2 = long_term_vol + a * \epsilon_{t-1}^2 + b * \sigma_{t-1}^2\]

<p>long_term_vol: fixed constant<br />
eps_t-1: residual derived from log return log(Rt/Rt-1) with mean removed<br />
sig_t-1: previous volatility (can be implied volatility from Black-Scholes)</p>

<p>interest rates often follow stochastic processes (e.g., Vasicek, CIR).</p>

    <p>Explain monte carlo
run large number of senarios to aggregate, useful when analytical solutions are difficult</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explain VaR for a portfolio<br />
VaR = Upper bound of Confidence interval for the loss<br />
ES = E[ loss | loss &gt; VaR]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>VaR ignores tail risk. One can say 99% confident Loss won’t exceed 1M, but within the 1% chance, don’t know if it’s 1M or 1B. ES addresses this</p>

<p>Also VAR is not subadditive: risk(A+B) &lt; risk(A) + risk(B), which encourage diversification</p>

<p>Simulate payoff with Geometric brownian motion
Then option price = e^-rT * (average payoff)</p>

<p>Used when Closed-form solutions are unavailable (e.g. multi-asset options)</p>

<p>Converges at O(1/sqrt(N)), very slow and expensive</p>

<h2 id="risk-management">Risk management</h2>
<p>Can use PCA to find which risks contribute to portfolio’s risk</p>

<p>Look for dimension of max variance, opposed to ICA which look for least entropy (least normal)</p>

<p>Also find which factors drive asset returns (macro factors)</p>

<h3 id="inefficiency-vs-arbitrage-free">Inefficiency vs Arbitrage-free</h3>

<p>A market can be inefficient but not arbitrage-free.</p>

<p>A stock may exhibit price momentum because markets fail to quickly incorporate information.</p>

<p>Traders could exploit this pattern (inefficiency) by predicting future price movements, but this involves risk.</p>

<p>At the same time, the market could be arbitrage-free because there are no riskless opportunities to exploit inconsistencies in pricing.</p>
