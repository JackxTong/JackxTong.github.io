<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>
<p>DNA language models apply techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to model biological sequences, treating DNA as a “language” to capture patterns, structures, and functional elements in genomic data. These models aim to understand and predict biological phenomena by encoding DNA sequences in a format that machine learning models can use.</p>

<p>Tokenization Methods: In DNA language models, tokenization is the process of breaking down DNA sequences into manageable units, or “tokens,” which represent the genetic information. State-of-the-art DNA models like Hyena used a mere character-level naive tokenizer, simply translating ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, ‘T’ to fixed integers. We were experimenting the adoptation of the 
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) method used in GPT3 and GPT4. The idea is to combine frequently occurring character pairs into single tokens iteratively, creating a hierarchy of tokens that balances between single characters and multi-character sequences.</p>

<h3 id="contribution">Contribution</h3>
<p>As part of the team to develop a BPE-based DNA LLM, my work mostly involves two parts.</p>

<p>Firstly, I worked on fine-tuning the hyperparameters like the vocab size for BPE, sequence length, context window etc for the DNA LLM. We built our model based on Olmo LLM <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-1B">1B</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/allenai/OLMo-7B">7B</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, I mostly worked on developping a modular evaluation framework that integrates our DNA LLM with downstream tasks (e.g. gene prediction, Protein-DNA interaction prediction) and benchmarks e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic_benchmarks">Genomic Benchmarks</a>, enabling automated performance evaluations and comparisons.</p>

<p>For example, this involves comparing our model’s performance with <a href="https://github.com/MAGICS-LAB/DNABERT_2">DNABERT2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna">Hyena</a>, both were established State-of-the-Art models on Genomic Benchmarks.</p>
