<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>This is an 8-session <a href="https://optiver.com/recruitment-events/imperial-college-london-x-optiver-trading-academy/">project</a> that covers both the foundations of options theory and hands-on algorithm development and testing. At the end of the session, I participated with other student traders together in a real-time trading challenge by designing our own Python trading algorithm based on real financial market data.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a delta-hedging trading algorithm that autonomously traded options in Optiverâ€™s simulated exchange, Optibook, leveraging the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.</li>
  <li>Trained an SVM model to dynamically adjust the credit for bid/ask prices based on liquidity, volatility, time to expiry, and historical price movements.</li>
  <li>Achieved positive PnL of $500,000, ranked in top 20% of participants in the contest with over 50 student traders.</li>
</ul>
